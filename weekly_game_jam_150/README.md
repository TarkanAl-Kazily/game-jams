# My Goals

- Practice "fail fast" and rapid prototyping based development
- Practice a robust workflow for accomplishing projects large and small:
   - Identify specific project goals for success and completion
   - Develop a plan to accomplish them on time and in budget
   - Achieve tasks in plan and iterate
- Publish the project
   - Start building an online profile/portfolio
   - Release a playable game - the key deliverable
   - Share with my network/social media
   - Document my thoughts and notes along the way, including a post mortem

# Game Jam Theme: "You're the enemy"

Lots of ways to take this, such as:

- Procrastination is the obstacle of accomplishing your goals
- Needing to accept your flaws to progress
- Being hero's main villan like in [Dungeon Keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper)
- Just being evil
- Your progression through the level sets up obstacles for the "next player", which is you

I'm interested in roguelike games, and good at playing simple, turn based games.
As this is my first stab into game development, I don't know exactly my
development strengths, but do plan to bring a layer oriented perspective to
software development.

A mechanic that I am interested in working with is the "Cappy" mechanic
from [Super Mario Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey)
in which Mario can capture enemies to navigate levels. In this way,
Mario "is" the enemy, at least for a time. How would this work in a roguelike?

# MVP mechanics:

Roguelike comes with a lot of baggage, which I won't deal with. To establish
a playable game in the 6 days, I'm highlighting these major elements:

1. The player, who can move and take actions.
2. The map, in which the player navigates. 
3. Enemies, which stop the player's progress. Key to this game mechanic is that
the player must become the enemy to proceed.
4. Progression towards a goal. The standard roguelike progression is through
floors, culminating in a macguffin.
